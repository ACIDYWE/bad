berkerley task short description.

Your task is to construct a proper packet that will bypass 
all of the filters.

This crackme requires root privileges to setup RAW-socket and
I think you should better use a virtualization system to run it,
it's a good practice after all (this challenge could be solved
even without running the binary).
